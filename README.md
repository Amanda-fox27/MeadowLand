Modding hub for the Desktop Meadow, delivered to you by the SamHub/ResourceHub project.

## [View Fonts, Resource Packs, And Sprite Packs Here](rp/index/INDEX.md)

## What can I add to Meadow Land?
"Resource Packs" for now, AKA modifying the "FormContent" folder, or you can add sprites using the NatureSheet xnb file AKA "Sprite Packs"

No decompiling and making actual mods for now please!

## Want to chat with the staff?!

Chat with us on [Sam's Discord](https://discord.gg/mXDzAzw) in the #desktop-meadow channel!

## Records!
GamerBoi153 was the first person to make a pack!

Pot Noodle was the first person to make a pack WORK! *clap clap clap!*

## Want to help?

Make a fork of MeadowLand [here](https://github.com/UnofficialSamHub/MeadowLand/) and send a pull request or make a pack for us! Even telling us how to mod the game more!
