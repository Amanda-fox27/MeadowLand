# How to make a Resource Pack with MLM

**MLM currently requires administrator permissions.** If you do not have administrator permissions, follow the FAQ instead.

1. Prepare the files (sprites, "Mail In" background, font) as shown in [the FAQ](../FAQ.md).
2. [Download](https://github.com/UnofficialSamHub/MeadowMaker/releases) and open MeadowLand Maker. **Extract the ZIP file instead of running MLM directly.**
3. Click "Make Pack".
4. Attach your sprites, "Mail In" background, and your font by clicking the "..." buttons next to the fields.
5. Type the "Font Name" from the FAQ into the Font Name field.
6. Type your Pack Name into the Pack Name field.
7. Finally, click the "Generate!" button. MLM will now generate your pack.
8. A folder will open containing your ZIP file. If something went wrong, MLM should notify you. If you get an error instead, please contact Vukky on the SamHub Discord.
